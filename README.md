# os3224_vagrant

wow, there is really nothing in this readme file. 
I'm going to use it to learn about branching and detaching heads!!
Woohoo! Let's commit this and see what happens!
I did 
git add -A
git commit -m "blah balah"
git push,
 but then I got
 $ git push
fatal: The current branch trytomakebranch has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin trytomakebranch
so I did  as it said,
git push --set-upstream origin trytomakebranch,
 and now everything is dandy.
 Let's commit and push this, make another and push and then try jumping around!!!
